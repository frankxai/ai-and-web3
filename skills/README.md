# Skills Hub

A central registry of agent skills for AI + Web3 work. This hub keeps the repo lean while making it easy to discover and extend skills across Claude, OpenCode, and Web3 tooling.

## What lives here
- Curated indices by category (Claude, OpenCode, AI, Web3, blockchain)
- Shared templates for skill authoring
- Pointers to external skills libraries and agents

## Categories
- Claude Code skills: `skills/claude/README.md`
- OpenCode skills: `skills/opencode/README.md`
- AI skills: `skills/ai/README.md`
- Web3 skills: `skills/web3/README.md`
- Blockchain skills: `skills/blockchain/README.md`

## Templates
- Skill template: `skills/templates/SKILL_TEMPLATE.md`

## How to add a skill
1) Pick a category and create a new folder for the skill.
2) Use the template in `skills/templates/SKILL_TEMPLATE.md`.
3) Add it to `resources/skills-catalog.md`.
4) Update the category README with a short entry.

## Recommended baseline
- Agent tooling: MCP, evals, and a tool registry
- Web3 ops: RPC, wallets, simulation, and spend limits
- Safety: explicit policies, dry-runs, and audit logs

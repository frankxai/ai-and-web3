# THE CREATOR'S SOULBOOK
*"Write the book your soul came here to write"*

## What This Skill Does

This skill guides you through creating your **personalized Soulbook** - a comprehensive document capturing your life vision, systems, and transformation journey across all 7 pillars of life.

When you run `/soulbook`, I will:
1. **Guide you through a discovery process** - asking deep questions to understand your life
2. **Create structured markdown files** - one for each pillar/area of your life
3. **Build your personal Soulbook** - a complete document of your life architecture
4. **Generate a beautiful PDF** - your finalized Soulbook ready to use

## Session Structure

### Phase 1: Discovery & Setup (5-10 minutes)
I'll ask you questions to understand:
- Which Life Book resonates with you
- Your current life situation
- Your transformation goals
- Your immediate priorities

### Phase 2: Deep Dive Sessions (Each Pillar: 10-15 minutes)
For each of the 7 pillars, I'll guide you through:
1. **Current State Assessment** - Where are you now? (1-10 rating + reflection)
2. **Vision Creation** - Where do you want to be? (Future state)
3. **Systems Design** - What habits/systems will get you there?
4. **Action Planning** - Next 30/60/90 day roadmap

Each pillar session creates a markdown file in your personal soulbook folder.

### Phase 3: Integration & Export (5 minutes)
- Review your complete Soulbook
- Make final edits
- Generate beautifully formatted PDF

**Total Time:** 2-3 hours (can be done in multiple sessions)

## File Structure Created

## The Questions I'll Ask (Sample)

### For Each Pillar:

**Current State:**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied are you with this area of life?"
- "What's working well?"
- "What's causing friction or pain?"
- "What have you tried before?"

**Vision State:**
- "Describe your ideal state in this pillar 1 year from now"
- "What would a 10/10 look like for you?"
- "What becomes possible when this pillar is strong?"

**Systems & Habits:**
- "What daily/weekly rituals would support this pillar?"
- "What systems need to be built?"
- "What needs to be eliminated or changed?"

**Action Planning:**
- "What are your top 3 priorities in this area for the next 30 days?"
- "What's one micro-commitment you can start this week?"
- "What support or resources do you need?"

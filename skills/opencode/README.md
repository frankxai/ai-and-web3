# OpenCode Skills

Skills designed for fast prototyping and build acceleration.

## Focus areas
- Repo scaffolding and cleanup
- Build/test automation
- Bug investigation and rapid fixes
- Tooling scripts and utilities

## Recommended patterns
- Start with a reproducible repro step
- Use minimal diffs and prefer templates
- Add short validation scripts where possible

## Contribution checklist
- Is the skill deterministic and fast?
- Are failure modes documented?
- Is there a clear handoff/output artifact?

# AI + Web3 Landscape

## Purpose
Provide a living snapshot of the most influential AI + Web3 repos, their differentiators, and the gaps we can own.

## Top Repos Snapshot (by category)

### Agent frameworks and networks
- IntentKit (crestalnetwork/intentkit) — autonomous agents with skills, blockchain and social integrations, MCP WIP.
- uAgents (fetchai/uAgents) — lightweight Python agents with on-chain registration and secure messaging.
- Open Autonomy (valory-xyz/open-autonomy) — decentralized, trust-minimized MAS for on-chain services.
- GaiaNet Node (GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node) — one-command install to run decentralized AI nodes.

### Protocols and delegation
- WORLD AI Protocol (WORLD3-ai/world_ai_protocol) — chain-agnostic, permissioned delegation with time/usage limits.

### SDKs and app platforms
- Covalent AI Agent SDK (covalenthq/ai-agent-sdk) — composable agents/tools/workflows with template quickstart.
- Ethora (dappros/ethora) — low-code engine for chat, AI assistants, and wallets (hub + satellites).

### Multi-agent systems
- Lux (Spectral-Finance/lux) — language-agnostic multi-agent framework with observability and testing.

## What top repos do consistently well
- Fast onboarding: one-command install or template scaffolds.
- Clear positioning and wedge with strong README and badges.
- Architecture diagrams and conceptual models to reduce cognitive load.
- Community channels (Discord/Telegram/X) and active contribution guidance.
- Strong emphasis on security and permissioning where on-chain actions exist.

## Gaps we can own (ai-and-web3 advantage)
- TypeScript-first, end-to-end labs with reproducible evaluation runs.
- A shared tool registry and MCP-first integration layer.
- Cross-chain labs with safety gates, spend limits, and deterministic playbooks.
- Comparative evaluations across frameworks on identical Web3 tasks.

## Implications for this repo
- Ship ready-to-run agents + labs that are small, composable, and measurable.
- Publish a visible benchmark/eval leaderboard.
- Maintain a tight, curated landscape map with updates every quarter.

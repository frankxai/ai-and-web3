# Example: Agent NFT Minter

High-level flow:
- Prepare image + metadata
- Pin to IPFS
- Mint ERC-721 on testnet

Start from `templates/agent-project.md`. For a full reference implementation, consider external repos for mint helpers and pinning services, then wire as tools in your agent framework of choice.
